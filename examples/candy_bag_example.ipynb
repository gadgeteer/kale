    "## Kubeflow Pipeline Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubeflow pipelines allow engineers to create a repeatable process for running different parts of machine learning model in parallel and on appropriate hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting a pipeline up and running is not easy. After a machine learning model is working, each of these steps must be completed to convert it into a pipeline: \n",
    "* Create Docker images for independent parts of the model\n",
    "* Write Kubeflow Pipeline orchestration code using the KFP DSL Python API\n",
    "* Compile Kubeflow Pipeline code, along with docker images, into a .tar.gz file\n",
    "* Upload compiled pipeline .tar.gz to Kubeflow\n",
    "* Create an Experiment in Kubeflow to organize Pipeline runs\n",
    "* Create a Run and then start it\n",
    "\n",
    "All the steps listed above can be done with a single click by using Kale. This notebook presents a minimal example to show how Kale can convert a Notebook to a pipeline when annotations have been added to the code blocks in the Jupyter Notebook file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are tagged for transformation into pipeline run parameters to let a pipeline be run with different inputs. Code cells can be divided into independent pipeline steps. Steps that are dependent on prior steps are tagged for propper pipeline creation. Imports and common functions are marked for inclusion with each independent pipeline process. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can look at the annotations by inspecting the Notebook source, or by installing the Kale jupyter extension (see [github.com/kubeflow-kale/jupyterlab-kubeflow-kale](https://github.com/kubeflow-kale/jupyterlab-kubeflow-kale))\n",
